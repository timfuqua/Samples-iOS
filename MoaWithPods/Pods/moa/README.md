Moa is an image download library written in Swift for iOS and OS X.
It allows to download and show an image in an image view by setting its `moa.url` property.

* Images are downloaded asynchronously.
* Uses NSURLSession for networking and caching.
* Allows to configure cache size and policy.
* Can be used without an image view.
* Provides closure properties for image manipulation and error handling.
* Includes unit testing mode for faking network responses.

## Setup

There are three ways you can add Moa to your Xcode project.

**Add source (iOS 7+)**

Simply add [MoaDistrib.swift](https://github.com/evgenyneu/moa/blob/master/Distrib/MoaDistrib.swift) file into your Xcode project.

**Setup with Carthage (iOS 8+)**

Alternatively, add `github "evgenyneu/moa" ~> 1.0` to your Cartfile and run `carthage update`.

**Setup with CocoaPods (iOS 8+)**

If you are using CocoaPods add this text to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

    use_frameworks!
    pod 'moa', '~> 1.0'

## Usage

1. Add `import moa` to your source code if you used Carthage or CocoaPods setup methods.

1. Set `moa.url` property of an image view to start asynchronous image download. The image will be automatically displayed when download is finished.

```Swift
imageView.moa.url = "http://site.com/image.jpg"
```

## Canceling download

Ongoing image download for the image view is automatically canceled when:

1. Image view is deallocated.
2. New image download is started: `imageView.moa.url = ...`.

Call `imageView.moa.cancel()` to manually cancel the download.





## Advanced features



### Supplying completion closure

Assign a closure that will be called when image is received.

```Swift
imageView.moa.onSuccessAsync = { image in
  return image
}

imageView.moa.url = "http://site.com/image.jpg"
```

The closure will be called *asynchronously* after download finishes and before the image
is assigned to the image view. This is a good place to manipulate the image before it is shown. The closure returns an image that will be shown in the image view. Return nil if you do not want the image to be shown.



### Supplying error closure

```Swift
imageView.moa.onErrorAsync = { error, response in
  // Handle error
}

imageView.moa.url = "http://site.com/image.jpg"
```

The closure is called *asynchronously* if image download fails. [See Wiki](https://github.com/evgenyneu/moa/wiki/Moa-errors) for the list of possible error codes.

**Closure arguments**:

*error*: NSError instance.

*response*: NSHTTPURLResponse instance.



### Download an image without an image view

An instance of `Moa` class can also be used without an image view. A strong reference to `Moa` instance needs to be kept.

```Swift
let moa = Moa()
moa.onSuccessAsync = { image in
  // image is loaded
  return image
}
moa.url = "http://site.com/image.jpg"
```


## Caching

Moa uses the built-in NSURLSession caching methods. It creates a dedicated cache storage that is separate from the app's shared url cache. You can change the cache settings at any moment by setting the `Moa.settings.cache` property.



#### Caching controlled by the server

By default images are cached locally according to their response HTTP headers: Cache-Control, Expires and ETag.
This is useful when you control the web server and can configure its image caching responses. It is similar to how the image caching is done in the web browsers where the caching decisions are made on the server side. Ilya Grigorik did an excellent overview of HTTP caching [in this article](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching?hl=en).

```Swift
// By default images are cached according to their response HTTP headers.
Moa.settings.cache.requestCachePolicy = .UseProtocolCachePolicy
```


#### Force caching on client side

If you don't control the server you can set the `requestCachePolicy` setting to `.ReturnCacheDataElseLoad`. It will load the images from local cache regardless of their age and expiration date.

```Swift
// Use local cache regardless of response HTTP headers.
Moa.settings.cache.requestCachePolicy = .ReturnCacheDataElseLoad
```




### Other cache settings

```Swift
// Change memory cache size. Default is 20 MB.
Moa.settings.cache.memoryCapacityBytes = 20 * 1024 * 1024

// Change disk cache size. Default is 100 MB.
Moa.settings.cache.diskCapacityBytes = 100 * 1024 * 1024

```


## Unit testing

Sometimes it is useful to prevent the code from making real HTTP requests. Moa includes `MoaSimulator` class for testing image downloads and faking network responses. See [unit test manual](https://github.com/evgenyneu/moa/wiki/Unit-testing-with-Moa) for more information.


## Demo app

The demo iOS app shows how to load images in a collection view with Moa.

swift-factory
=============

This simple repository shows how to instantiate classes by class name in Swift.
It uses Objective-C interop to perform the actual object creation.
A generic utility Swift class named ObjectFactory provides a convenience API.

This code was tested against the first beta of iOS 8.
The sample project is an OS X command line for the sake of simplicity.

Refer to main.swift to see how to use ObjectFactory.
